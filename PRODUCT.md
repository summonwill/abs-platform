# ABS Studio — Product Vision

> **The Governance Framework with a GUI**

---

## 🎯 Core Concept

ABS Studio is the **automated version** of AI Bootstrap Systems.

The free tier gives users governance files (AI_RULES_AND_BEST_PRACTICES.md, etc.) that they manually manage. ABS Studio **automates everything** — users open a project, start a session, and governance happens automatically in the background.

**Tagline:** "The Governance OS for Safe, Predictable AI Development"

## 👥 Target Users

### Individual Developers (Pro - $19/mo)
- Solo devs using AI coding assistants (Cursor, Copilot, Claude)
- Want structure without the overhead
- Bring their own API keys
- Value: "Just works" governance

### Small Teams (Team - $299/mo)
- 5-20 person dev teams
- Need consistent AI behavior across team members
- Shared governance policies
- Value: Consistency + audit trail

### Enterprises (Custom)
- Large organizations with compliance requirements
- SOC2, HIPAA needs
- SSO integration
- Value: Compliance + certification

## 💡 Value Proposition

### Free Tier (Manual) Pain Points
1. Must manually create SESSION_NOTES.md every session
2. Must copy/paste AI_RULES into every chat
3. Must track TODO.md by hand
4. No persistent context across sessions
5. No file management integration
6. Time-consuming, easy to forget

### Pro Tier (ABS Studio) Solutions
1. ✅ SESSION_NOTES auto-generated and maintained
2. ✅ AI_RULES auto-loaded into every AI session
3. ✅ TODO integrated into UI
4. ✅ Full chat history with session persistence
5. ✅ File explorer with AI operations
6. ✅ Seamless, instant, no manual work

**Upgrade trigger:** After manually managing governance files for a few sessions, the automation becomes obviously worth $19/mo.

## 🔑 AI Provider Strategy

### Current (Bring Your Own Key)
- OpenAI (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini)
- Anthropic (Claude)
- Google Gemini

### Planned (Free/Low-Cost Options)
- **Ollama** — Free, local, private, OpenAI-compatible API
- **OpenRouter** — One API key, access to free tier models (Llama, Mistral)
- **DeepSeek** — Very cheap alternative

### Enterprise (Managed)
- Bulk API keys provisioned by organization
- Admin configures keys on backend
- Users don't see/manage keys
- Usage tracking and cost allocation

## 🚨 Competitive Differentiation

| Feature | ABS Studio | Cursor | VS Code Copilot |
|---------|------------|--------|-----------------|
| Governance built-in | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Session persistence | ✅ | Partial | ❌ |
| Multi-provider | ✅ | Limited | ❌ (OpenAI only) |
| File operations by AI | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Audit trail | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Determinism testing | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Open source core | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |

**Unique value:** Not just an AI coding tool — it's **governed** AI coding.

## 🔮 Long-Term Vision

ABS Studio becomes the **standard development environment** for governed AI-assisted development.

Every enterprise that uses AI coding tools will need governance. ABS provides:
1. The framework (free, builds ecosystem)
2. The tooling (Pro/Team, generates revenue)
3. The certification (Enterprise, high margin)

**5-year goal:** "If you use AI for coding, you use ABS for governance."
